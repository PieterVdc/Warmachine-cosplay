# Warmachine-cosplay
## intro

cosplay buildlog of the Ironman 2 version of warmachine\
--insert pic of finished cosplay--

started building 

## references

started by watching the movie, and taking screenshots,\
also found [this warmachine youtube compilation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aNuh1j124o)
first 3 minutes are of the Iron man 2 Movie, just missing the roof scene, and an earlier close up of the ex-wife missle wich screenshots are in screenshot folder


 ## model

found a close 3d model online, model wasn't made for 3d printing, so will later need to do more work to make sure that they are
started by comparing all details of the model to the references collected earlier, 
for the most part what was in the movie and model matched, found couple minor things like 
model had a part of the bacv simply missing, looks like an accidental delete, on the modelers side
![missing back](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f9cf4a1-4a7b-4e7c-8caa-c7b9e020bc73)
this indent on the shoulder ![shoulder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d70ebb60-4649-4cb3-ba8a-df1b578bbc39)
and on the leg, those are 2 seperate panels instead of a solid piece
![leg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3d46a9b-93d0-44d9-bc59-048e8a22f843)

leg, even though accurate to the movie seems to have the thruster intersecting with where my lower leg is supposed to be, so that part will also need to be tackled if it's going to be something I can actually wear
