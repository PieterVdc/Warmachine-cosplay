## references

started by watching the movie, and taking screenshots,\
also found [this warmachine youtube compilation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aNuh1j124o)
first 3 minutes are of the Iron man 2 Movie, just missing the roof scene, and an earlier close up of the ex-wife missle wich screenshots are in screenshot folder

## improvements over the mk39

the mk39 leg movement is very limited, can only walk slowly and have a high chance of breaking something when walking up stairs, so that's definitly something I want to improve,\
functionality wise the mk39 led eyes, motor for the faceplate, but those were to weak to really lift the plate and a repulsor led in the right hand, 
for warmachine I'd like to so at least those, and also add thrusters with smoke and opening clap, and make the mini gun rotate\
paint wise, this time I'll go with laquer instead of acrylic\
mk39 also had some quite thin panels, with 3dprinting you can easily make them bit thicker without adding weight, greatly improving strenght, thus avoiding trips to the repair booth when used on a con

 ## model

found a close 3d model online, model wasn't made for 3d printing, so will later need to do more work to make sure that they are
started by comparing all details of the model to the references collected earlier, 
for the most part what was in the movie and model matched, found couple minor things like 
model had a part of the bacv simply missing, looks like an accidental delete, on the modelers side

this indent on the shoulder ![shoulder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d70ebb60-4649-4cb3-ba8a-df1b578bbc39)
and on the leg, those are 2 seperate panels instead of a solid piece

leg, even though accurate to the movie seems to have the thruster intersecting with where my lower leg is supposed to be, so that part will also need to be tackled if it's going to be something I can actually wear
